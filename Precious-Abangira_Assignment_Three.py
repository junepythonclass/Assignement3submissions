# Operators
# An operator is  a symbol that tells Python to do something with one or more values. For example, in "5 + 3", the "+" is the operator, and 5 and 3 are the values it works on.

print("OPERATORS")

# Arithmetic Operators - used for doing math
# +   add
# -   subtract
# *   multiply
# /   divide (always gives back a decimal)
# %   modulus - gives the remainder of a division
# **  exponent - raises a number to a power
# //  floor division - divides, then rounds down to a whole number

print("\nArithmetic Operators")

print("a / b  =", a / b)
print("a % b  =", a % b)
print("a ** b =", a ** b)
print("a // b =", a // b)

# Comparison Operators - used to compare two values. These always give back True or False.
# ==  equal to
# !=  not equal to
# >   greater than
# <   less than
# >=  greater or equal
# <=  less or equal

print("x >= y :", x >= y)
print("x <= y :", x <= y)

# Logical Operators - used to combine conditions
# and  - True only if both sides are True
# or   - True if at least one side is True
# not  - flips True to False, or False to True

# Assignment Operators - used to store or update a variable's value
# =   assign a value
# +=  add, then save - same as x = x + 3
# -=  subtract, then save - same as x = x - 3
# *=  multiply, then save - same as x = x * 3
# /=  divide, then save - same as x = x / 3

# A data type tells Python what kind of value a variable is holding. Python figures this out automatically based on what you assign.

# Conditional Statements
# Conditional statements let your program make decisions and run different code depending on whether something is True or False. The indented lines only run when the condition above them is True.

# if...elif...else lets you line up several possible conditions and have Python check them one after another, top to bottom, stopping and running the matching block as soon as it finds the first one that's true, and falling back to else if none of them are.
